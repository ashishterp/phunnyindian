          Because our favorite people are located all over and have insane
          schedules, it's actually several virtual showers on Zoom â€” you have a
          few days from which to choose.

          The showers will be like us: short & sweet. 30 minutes. Rajiv will do
          some standup and Harsha will get a word in edgewise at some point.

          We won't play any games but we do wanna hear if anyone has any boy
          name suggestions.

          This may come as a surprise since Rajiv's so public, but since
          Harsha's so private (Wouldn't you be if you married Rajiv?), we're not
          sharing this news broadly, on social media, etc. This is a special
          event and we're inviting you, our friends.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          All kidding aside, thank you for sharing this moment with us. We're
          over the moon. And the sun.

        Us,
